To get started:
When creating project templates - use the whole project "RS-Base Clean""
When creating the item template for windows - use the EmptyWindowV.xaml under "RS-Base Example"

* Close Visual Studio.
* Copy "RS-Base Vx.zip" and put in "%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Visual Studio 2019\Templates\ProjectTemplates".
* Copy "RS-Base Window Vx.zip" and "RS-Base TabControlWindow Vx.zip" and put in "%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Visual Studio 2019\Templates\ItemTemplates".

When creating a new Project or Item these template will show up.

You need to have .Net Core 3.1 installed.
If the references gives you any troubles: Run the command "Update-Package -Reinstall" (without "") in the Package-Manager console

Tips:
Use LogExpert to read the logfiles. LogExpert can tail the logfile very efficient. Can be used as a stand-alone console window in a sense.
Use ResX Manager for handling the Resource files. It's a very convenient tool. It's both availible as a standalone app and a extension to Visual Studio.
There is a compiled version of MaterialDesignForXAML to be used as a cheat set to se what types of controls are availible.

REMEMBER TO GO TO TOOLS-OPTIONS-ENVIRONMENT-PREVIEW FEATURES and check "Use Previews of the .NET Core SDK (Requiers restart)" to make the WPF designer to work in VS 2019.

Have fun!
